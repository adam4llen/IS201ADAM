    <ol>
        <li>Carlsbad is an amazing place. It's where I grew up, and a big part of who I am. I lived there until serving an LDS mission, in which I served in the Washington Yakima Mission. When I returned home from my mission, I lived in Idaho and Utah ever since. </li>
        <ul>   
        </ul>
        <li>I also love accounting and finance. I am applying to both programs, with the dreams of one day becoming a financial advisor</li>
